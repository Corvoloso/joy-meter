# Joy Meter

A Joy meter is my repo dedicated to the study of animations inside the React Native enviroment. Allowing me to get the very basic of **ANY**mation

Interested in running yourself? you can do it so by runing the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/IgorABezerra/joy-meter.git
```

When you finish the clone you can follow the next steps:
Get the dependencies of the *App*.

```
yarn
```

Install in your device of preference, the following commands can serve to both platforms runing in a emulator or a physical device (by usb means):

#### Android
```
yarn android
```

### IOS
```
yarn ios
```

### Run the App
Get things up and running, the following command will get the application running after you make the instalation inside your device.

```
yarn start
```

after that you should get the following screen:

Now you can enjoy yourself a little ***work in progress***, a project to try do get some animations done.

Thank you for reading until now, hope this could be useful to get the project runing and hope you liked it, feel free to get some issues running for me. I do intend to get some more things running in the project over the time
